                    <repairbody>Choose one of the following three approaches for your workers to use when deciding how and when to conduct maintenance and repairs in your airport.

Only During Window
Start repairs on an object only during the window and stop repairing the objects immediately when the window ends. You may still manually override the window for any given individual object.

Always Finish
Once a repair begins on an object, the workers will ALWAYS finish it compltely -- even if the maintenance window ends, they will continue repairing until the object is completely finished.

Any Time
Ignores the window entirely. Workers will begin repairs [i]any time[/i] an object falls under the configured threshold, even outside of the configured maintenance window and they will continue repairing the object completely.</repairbody>

The more they are satisfied with your service, the more flights they will offer and the less demands they will make.</Tutorial1>
        <Tutorial2>Use the atmosphere to work out how positively or negatively the airline is reacting to your changes. Use the text input boxes to type in new offers, or use the sliders.

Up to one offer can be made non-negotiable, which will make them stick with that value. However, this may hinder their ability to return you their best offer.

Remember to read the contract breaches section, and checkout the current deal you have with this airline.</Tutorial2>

        <CFO>Specifically, the CFO adjusts the figures to make it possible for airlines to accept a deal that's slightly worse for them. Just don't tell anyone this!</CFO>
        <COO>Specifically, each facility added in the negotiations will be worth more, meaning you can charge higher prices!</COO>
        <CTO>Specifically, when some airlines create a counter offer, they try to take into consideration what they believe is important to you based on your current airport setup and your counter offers. This CTO gives extra detail to the airline, so that they can do this even more. For example, if you had 3 spare offices, they would be more likely to ask for offices.</CTO>
        <Foreman>Specifically, asking for custom flights in the negotiations rather than waiting for them to offer you flights is expensive for them. This will reduce how much Large and Extra Large planes will affect their demands.</Foreman>
        <FinanceVP>Just like the CFO, but slightly less effectively, they adjust the figures to make it possible for airlines to accept a deal that's slightly worse for them. Just don't tell anyone this!</FinanceVP>
